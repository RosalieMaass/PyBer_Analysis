# PyBer_Analysis
## Analysis Overview
We are analyzing ride share data from PyBer. We created multiple charts using python data, jupyter notebook, and matplotlib to showcase different cities, number of riders, number of drivers, and average fares. We also looked at different months of the year to determine peak season.

## Results
With this data, we learned a few key things:
* The number of riders is highest in urban areas and lowest in rural areas
* The ride fare, on average, is lowest in urban areas, and highest in rural areas
* The number of drivers is much higher in urban areas, 36 on average, and only 4 on average in rural areas
* We learned that 62.7% of total fares come from urban areas with rural areas accounting for just 6.8%
* The percentage of total rides by city type high highest in urban ares at 68.4% and lowest in rural ares at just 5.3%
* The percentage of total drivers is highest in urban areas at 80.9% and lowest in rural ares at 2.6 percent.
* We also learned that March through July typicallyhas the highest fares, with August, September and January having the lowest fares.

## Summary
In Summary, urban areas have the highest number of riders, drivers, and rides, and rural ares are lowest in all of these categories.
Overall, most of PyBer's business and revenue is generated in urban areas.
